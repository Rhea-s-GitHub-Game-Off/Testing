**üé≠ Customizable personality system:** Your hero can be a friendly and kind presence to those around them, a playful and joking wisecracker, or an assertive and focused hero who's focused on their goals. Or, they could be a mix of all of these at once! The choice is yours.

**üëë The Valour system:** Instead of traditional levelling, TSWB has a system called Valour. You gain Valour by making choices that best align with your hero's strengths and personality. In battle against formidable enemies, your Valour will give you an extra edge.

‚ùÑ **Beautiful effects that take the power of the web to the next level:** TSWB harnesses the power of several amazing animation libraries such as [Particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) to bring a truly fantastic experience‚ÄîAll in the palm of your hand!

**üí≤ Web Monetization:** If you have a Coil membership and the respective web extension, you'll have access to exclusive premium scenes! This includes extra scenes with the characters, quests to find items that will help you in battles during your adventure, and more chances to gain Valour.
